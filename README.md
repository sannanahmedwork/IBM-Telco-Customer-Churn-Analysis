# IBM Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project investigates customer churn patterns to support retention strategies for a telecommunications company. Using MySQL and the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, we examined key factors influencing churn, such as demographics, contract types, payment methods, and customer feedback.

## Project Objectives

Our analysis focused on addressing three main questions:

### Personalized Offers for High-Value Churned Segments
- **How can tailored offers**, based on age, gender, and contract type, be used to retain the top customer segments with the highest average monthly charges?

### Customer Feedback Analysis
- **What are the primary reasons for churn** according to customer feedback? 
- **Which issues are most commonly cited** among churned customers?

### Impact of Payment Methods on Churn
- **How does the choice of payment method** influence a customer's likelihood to churn?

## Approach

The project relied on SQL queries to:

- Segment customers by key attributes to identify high-value groups that had churned.
- Aggregate customer feedback to understand common themes behind churn.
- Calculate churn rates for each payment method to identify patterns and potential opportunities for intervention.
